NC2PNG
Generate preview and time estimations based on gcode file (milling)

Files in this folder are mainly used for debug purpose.
Theses files can you placed in program folder (e.g. nc2png/glsl_shaders/) to edit shaders ""on-the-fly"" (you still need to restart program for edits to take place).
To avoid confusion, it is highly recommanded to edit "nc2png.cfg" and set "debugOpenGL" to 1 to know if external shader compiled successfully.
 
If you found a glitch or made a improvement to one of theses shaders, please open a new issue on the Github page.
